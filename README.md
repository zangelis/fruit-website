# Fruit Website

In this project I used image sliders to change the picture, fruit name and background color depending on which fruit the user clicks on.

## Installation & Usage
To check out my code, just clone the repository like this:
```
git clone https://github.com/zangelis/fruit-website.git
cd fruit-website
```
If you want to view the page in the browser, copy the path from index.html and paste it into the search bar.
